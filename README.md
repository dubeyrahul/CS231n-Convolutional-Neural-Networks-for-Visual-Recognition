# CS231n-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Visual-Recognition
This repository has solutions of assignments that I am solving from Stanford's Deep Learning course on Convolutional Neural Networks
The code is written in Python and the assignments can be found here:
http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2016/syllabus.html

Major take away from doing these exercises are:
1. Writing efficient vectorized NumPy code
2. Understanding the mechanics underneath the algorithm
3. Understanding how computational graph works and how gradient back propagates
